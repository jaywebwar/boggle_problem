This should be the solution to the problem we worked on yesterday.

It is intended to be run in the terminal:
$python3 boggle_problem.py

It'll show you a mapping similar to what you wrote on the board. Then wait for your input.  The whole word does have to be capitalized.

Note: It doesn't work for one letter words, and it doesn't check a dictionary to ensure you've actually written a word.  Also, I typically delete the print statements, but I thought you may be interested to see the lines that were used for debugging purposes.
